//! Interactive-play state machine — drives a `Game` one action at a time so
//! a human, a networked client, or the WASM bridge can pump each decision.
//!
//! Shares `Engine::draw_card` and `Engine::commit_play` with the simulator
//! (`game::Game`), so a fully-bot-driven `InteractiveGame` produces a
//! `GameHistory` byte-identical to `Game::play()` for the same seed and
//! strategies. That invariant is the primary integrity guarantee of the
